For the world's highest impact, hardest-to-treat illnesses like pancreatic cancer, developing novel therapies requires looking beyond single-pathway genetic or biochemical analyses and getting a view of the entire picture. Multiplexed imaging and spatial proteomics with Cell DIVE from Leica Microsystems is a way to achieve highly multiplexed images (with 60+ biomarkers) in a single piece of human tissue using a robust, tissue-preserving workflow.\nIn this story, we will introduce you to the complex biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and investigate molecular and spatial determinants of tumor cell agression at the level of metabolism, apoptosis, and immunity.",

The pancreas' close proximity to many major organ systems makes this cancer particularly dangerous. Moreover, the highly heterogenous nature of the depicted tumor type, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma poses a special challenge to therapy development. Some of the more invasive and aggressive regions of the tumor are especially refractory to novel treatments.\nThe biomarkers depicted here show the overall architecture of the tumor. The differential staining of two, paired pan-cytokeratin clones allow the tumor regions to be differentiated from normal tissue. NaKATPase stains plasma membrane. Vimentin marks stromal tissue. CD31 is a marker for blood vessels.",

The physical constraints imposed by extracellular matrix material offer an intriguing hypothesis into why hypoxic cells are more aggressive. Could desmoplasia lead to a physical hardening of tissues that traps immune cells and block apoptosis? Future imaging with additional biomarkers could directly address this potential mechanism.",
